CS 230 Module Eight Journal – Software Design Reflection

Project Summary:

The client for this course was The Gaming Room, a company that wanted to bring their trivia game, “Draw It or Lose It,” to a wider audience through a web-based, multi-platform system. They needed a design that could support multiple players, stay secure, and perform smoothly across different devices. My job was to design a software solution that met those needs and explain it clearly in a way that made sense to both the client and a development team.

What I Did Well:

One thing I felt confident about in this course was how clearly I was able to communicate my design ideas. My instructor mentioned that my executive summary was strong and that I explained complex concepts in a simple, effective way. I also did well with implementing the Singleton pattern and building logical, well-structured solutions. As the course went on, I improved at platform analysis and security planning, especially in Project Three, where my layered security model and cloud-native approach really came together.

What I Found Helpful:

Working through the software design document was honestly one of the most useful parts of the course. Writing everything out step-by-step forced me to really think through each decision through completion of this project. It gave me a better understanding of how everything, like user requirements, platforms, and architecture connect. That process made the development side smoother because I already had a clear plan to follow.

What I Would Revise:

If I could go back and adjust something, I’d fix how I implemented the Iterator pattern in Project One. I relied on enhanced for-loops for some methods instead of explicit iterators, which didn’t meet the full technical requirement. It’s a small detail, but getting that part right would’ve made the design more precise and complete.

Understanding and Implementing User Needs:

I focused a lot on the user’s experience throughout the design. The client wanted something that was easy to use, accessible, and scalable, so I designed the system with a responsive, mobile-first layout and made sure it could handle different devices and network speeds. Keeping the user’s needs front and center made the project more practical and realistic.

My Approach to Software Design:

When I design software, I like to start by breaking down what’s needed and sketching out how the parts will fit together, while consitently reviewing requirements and documentations to ensure all aspect required are covered. Moving forward, I want to continue using that structured approach,while also getting more feedback earlier in the process to catch any small technical issues before they become largert issues later on.
